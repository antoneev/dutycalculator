                <p>Know Da Price, was a concept created by three ambitious college students who wanted to solve one of
                    the many problems individuals face when shipping items into the country. <b>Everyone is
                        guessing.</b> After seeing the demand of islanders refusal of clearing personal items and
                    allowing shipping companies to seize their acquired goods, something had to be done! There are
                    endless testimonies of individuals who go to cash out at their respective freight carrier and
                    realize that their items were doubled the expected price. Or, not being able to see how much it
                    would be to clear their item until after they’ve bought it and submitted their invoices.</p>
                <p>The goal of the duty calculator is to reduce patron’s time spent at shipping companies bewildered at
                    invoice totals. By focusing on customer awareness and satisfaction, we hope to diminish the hassle
                    of collecting items once they are provided with accurate estimates beforehand.</p>
                <p>Our website model is quite simple. We provide a general estimate of how much you should pay for your
                    items before you even add them to your shopping cart! You can sit in the comfort of your home, add
                    all of your items to your shopping cart, then you can jump onto Know Da Price and add each of those
                    items into our simple interface and receive an estimate of how much you should pay your courier
