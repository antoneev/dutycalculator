        <p>Know Da Price, was a concept created by three ambitious college students who wanted to solve one of
            the many problems individuals face when shipping items into the country. <b>Everyone is
                guessing.</b> After seeing the demand of islanders refusal of clearing personal items and
            allowing shipping companies to seize their acquired goods, something had to be done! There are
            endless testimonies of individuals who go to cash out at their respective freight carrier and
            realize that their items were doubled the expected price. Or, not being able to see how much it
            would be to clear their item until after they’ve bought it and submitted their invoices.</p>
        <p>The goal of the duty calculator is to reduce patron’s time spent at shipping companies bewildered at
            invoice totals. By focusing on customer awareness and satisfaction, we hope to diminish the hassle
            of collecting items once they are provided with accurate estimates beforehand.</p>
        <p>Our website model is quite simple. We provide a general estimate of how much you should pay for your
            items before you even add them to your shopping cart! You can sit in the comfort of your home, add
            all of your items to your shopping cart, then you can jump onto Know Da Price and add each of those
            items into our simple interface and receive an estimate of how much you should pay your courier
            service. </p>
